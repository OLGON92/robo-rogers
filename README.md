## Description

_This is my third project for Epicodus that is meant to show off my ability to us Arrays and Looping. The user will enter any number they wish and get a "robot-like" response; what that means is that a number with 1, 2, or 3 will be replaced with a specific phrase, and any number that is not 1, 2, or 3 will remain unchanged. Here is a [link](https://github.com/OLGON92/robo-rogers) to the repository on GitHub._
